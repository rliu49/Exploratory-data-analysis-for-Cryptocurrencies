## Data description:
 
 The data used in this project is originally from the coinmarketcap.com(url =  "https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker/?limit=10" ). But this dataset only allow us to access the first 100 coins. So I use the API on Dec 6th 2017 and save the data as csv file. 
 
 Below is the basic data description:

### Discard irrelevant information 

Since this project focus on the market capitalization of different cryptocurrencies, we could discard those coins without a market capitalization.

After dealing with the missing value, use a bar plot to show what are the 10 coins has the largest market capitalization (in percentage).
